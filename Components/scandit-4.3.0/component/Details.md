Example
-------

Integrating the Scandit SDK into your Xamarin app is very straightforward:

iOS:

```csharp
// Setup the barcode scanner
var picker = new ScanditSDK.SIBarcodePicker ("---- ENTER YOUR APP KEY HERE ----");
picker.OverlayController.Delegate = new YourDelegate ();

// Display the Scandit user interface
some_ui_view_controller_object.PresentViewController (picker, true, null);

picker.StartScanning ();
```

```csharp
using ScanditSDK;

public class YourDelegate : SIOverlayControllerDelegate
{
	public override void DidScanBarcode (SIOverlayController overlayController, NSDictionary barcode) {
		// perform actions after a barcode was scanned
		);
	}
}
```


Android:

```csharp

public class ScanActivity : Activity, Scandit.Interfaces.IScanditSDKListener
	{
		private ScanditSDKBarcodePicker picker;
		public static string appKey = "---- ENTER YOUR APP KEY HERE ----";

		protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
		{
			base.OnCreate (bundle);

			// Setup the barcode scanner
			picker = new ScanditSDKBarcodePicker (this, appKey);
			picker.OverlayView.AddListener (this);

			// Start scanning
			picker.StartScanning ();

			// Show scan user interface
			SetContentView (picker);
		}

		public void DidScanBarcode (string barcode, string symbology) {
			Console.WriteLine ("barcode scanned: {0}, '{1}'", symbology, barcode);

		public void DidCancel () {
			Console.WriteLine ("Cancel was pressed.");
		}

		public void DidManualSearch (string text) {
			Console.WriteLine ("Search was used.");
		}
}
```
